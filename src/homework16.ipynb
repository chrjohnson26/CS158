The `Linear` and `ReLU` classes will define layers of a Neural Network. The `Sequential` class defines a particular network, given a list of layers.\n","\n","For example, consider the following code:\n","```\n","layer1=Linear(2,3)\n","layer2=ReLU()\n","layer3=Linear(3,1)\n","network=Sequential([layer1,layer2,layer3])\n","```\n","\n","Here, layer1 takes a feature matrix with 2 columns (features), and produces a matrix with the same number of rows and 3 columns by a simple linear function defined by 2 coefficients (the \"weights\" or \"kernel\") and 1 intercept (the \"bias\") . You should visualize this as two neurons feeding into 3 neurons. layer2 accepts the output of layer 1, and produces an output of similar size where all of the negative entries have been set to 0. This is considered an \"activation\" layer. Incluion of such a layer is what makes the network capable of modeling non-linear data. Finally, the last layer produces a single output for each observation.\n","\n","All three classes (Sequential, Linear and ReLU) should have a `__call__` method. If `X` is a feature matrix of shape (n,2), then running `network(X)` after the above code will call the `__call__` methods of each layer, and produce a matrix of shape (n,1).\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YW9aKNRvlB1C"},"outputs":[],"source":["class Linear():\n","    '''Fully connected linear layer class'''\n","    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):\n","        np.random.seed(1) #Don't use in practice!
